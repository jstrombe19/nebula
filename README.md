# NEBULA

### Baseline implementations of various sandboxed concepts brought together in a single cohesive whole.

The motivation behind this project is to work through the process of integrating disparate parts. The 
project leverages YAML files for configuration settings pulled at runtime as well as commented basic 
implementation details that are then converted into auto-generated cpp and hpp files with stubs for 
the detailed types.
